    "story": "It's becoming hard to take Donald Trump's claims of getting serious seriously. On Monday in Youngstown, Ohio, Trump spoke about his proposed immigration ideology test, as well as further claims about how he would be strong on terrorism. After a week of bad news for Trump, coming on the heels of an even worse week for Trump, his speech in Ohio was supposed to convince voters skeptical of his antics that he could act like a normal presidential candidate, talk about issues, and get his message out."

    "story": "The 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have been an unforgettable experience. Though the Games are only halfway over, we've already witnessed some truly historic moments. We saw the Refugee Olympics Team compete for the first time, and watched Fiji win its first-ever medal (a gold in rugby). In swimming, Michael Phelps earned his 23rd (and final) gold medal in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay, while Katie Ledecky racked up four gold medals and one silver, breaking a world record in the process. Team USA continues to dominate basketball, with the women winning their 45th straight Olympic game and the men winning their 25th straight. And of course, gymnast Simone Biles has earned three gold medals in memorable fashion, with the floor exercise (her best event) still to come."
